# Index of Repositories Related to UCSB NRS Sites
This document aggregates links to existing repositories related to research occurring at UCSB NRS sites. The index is organized by site, then by research group (if applicable) with brief descriptions accompanying links to each project. 

If you work on research at or related to UCSB NRS sites, we'd like to point to your work! Reach out to us with a link and description of your project and we can add it to the index. Our goal is to increase visibility of research occurring at the sites and facilitate collaboration.

Alternatively, we can showcase your repository by forking it to the organization repository list where it will be set up to automatically update.    

# Coal Oil Point Reserve (COPR)   

## Please visit COPR's GitHub page
Repositories include R code for a Shiny App that desplays Devereux Slough water quality data

__[COPR GitHub](https://github.com/UCSB-COPR)__

# Santa Cruz Island Reserve (SCI)   
## Moore Foundation - Building Resilience to Wildfires Grant   
These repositories are associated with work done in support of the Building Resilience to Wildfire grant from the Moore Foundation.    

__[Santa Cruz Island Fog Analysis](https://github.com/UCSB-NRS/sci-fog-analysis)__       
Fog is an important but understudied component of the climate. It's critical to the survival of several island endemics, including Bishop Pine, but how its temporal and spatial distribution may shifting due to climate change is not well understood. This repository contains analyses related to fog on Santa Cruz Island, including microclimate variability between sites, trends in low clouds and fog over time, inference of fog from standard weather station measurements.       

__[Santa Cruz Island WRF Fog and Low Clouds Evaluation](https://github.com/UCSB-NRS/sci-wrf-analysis)__          
Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model outputs can be an invaluable tool for investigating questions related to fog climatology, but its performance in simulating fog and low clouds is not well understood. If it performs well, then WRF can provide high spatial resolution data on fog - a facet of the climate for which observational data is scarce and difficult to collect. This repository contains analyses comparing WRF outputs with satellite data and weather station data to evaluate it performance in simulating low clouds and fog for Santa Cruz Island.    

# Sierra Nevada Aquatic Research Laboratory (SNARL)   

## [Mountain Lakes Research Group](https://mountainlakesresearch.com/)   
__[Capture-Mark-Recapture Population Analysis for the Endangered Mountain Yellow-Legged Frog](https://github.com/SNARL1/cmr-analysis)__       
A reproducible research compendium containing the data and analyses focused on actions conducted to recover populations of the endangered mountain yellow-legged frog.   

__[Frog Growth](https://github.com/SNARL1/frog-growth)__    
Code and data in this repository pertain to a study of growth of the mountain yellow-legged frog in the Sierra Nevada mountains, California.  

__[Translocations to Re-establish Populations of the Mountain Yellow-Legged Frog](https://github.com/SNARL1/translocation)__   
This repository is organized as a reproducible research compendium, and describes frog translocations to reestablish populations of the endangered mountain yellow-legged frog. It contains data on frog survival following translocations conducted during the period 2006-2020, R code to identify predictors of survival and estimate population viability, a notebook to document translocation-related analyses, and a manuscript.  

__[Re-establishing Frog Populations Using Animals From Multiple Donor Sites](https://github.com/SNARL1/multidonor)__   
This repository contains data, code, and reports related to the "multi-donor" project, project aimed at studying the use of multiple donor populations to re-establish mountain yellow-legged frogs at sites in Yosemite and Kings Canyon National Parks from which they were extirpated.    

__[Comparing Frog Survival in Translocation versus Reintroductions](https://github.com/SNARL1/translocate-reintroduce)__     


__[Disease and climate effects on individuals drive post-reintroduction population dynamics of an endangered amphibian.](https://github.com/SNARL1/sierra-reintroduction-cmr)__     
This repository contains models and data to understand how the amphibian chytrid fungus _Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis_ and climatic conditions drive population dynamics of Sierra Nevada yellow-legged frogs. It combines a capture mark-recapture model with a joint model for Bd/host dynamics that accommodates known introductions of hosts. This is associated with the paper Disease and climate effects on individuals drive post-reintroduction population dynamics of an endangered amphibian.
